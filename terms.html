            <div class="row text-justify">
                <p>The 30 Day Trial Period starts when the order is placed. You will be responsible to pay Shipping and Handling charges for your first shipment of Cell Parer and Maximum Renewal Complex (“Product”). If you wish to cancel your order within your Trial Period, simply call 1-310-274-5141 and return the containers (even if empty!) within 30 days from the shipping date and we will not charge you anything other than the shipping and handling fee. If you love the Product, just do nothing and at the end of your Trial Period your credit card provided today will be charged $99.00 and you will be automatically enrolled in the S T Go Loyalty Savings Program. This means that in about 30 days from the end of your Trial Period and every 60 days thereafter, you will be shipped a new 2 months supply of Cell Parer and Maximum Renewal Complex for the discounted low price of $99.00 (This set is regularly priced at $149.00, that is a 33% savings). Shipping is FREE for customers within the United States. Remember, you can cancel at any time by contacting our Customer Service at 1-310-274-5141 or emailing info@stgo.com. Today's charges and future charges will appear on your credit card as S T Go Skin Care. In addition to free enrollment in the S T Go Loyalty Savings Program, you will also be subscribed to our S T Go Mailing List to receive occasional emails about new products, promotions, and free beauty and skin care tips.</p>
                <p>We do not charge your card (besides S/H) for 30 days. Keep in mind all transactions on this website are in USD. If your financial institution operates with a currency other than USD, they may assess an international currency exchange fee.</p>
